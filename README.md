Raspberry Pi New Analogue-Digital Synthesizer

This project aims to turn the Raspberry Pi into an analogue-to-digital synthesizer.
The idea is to produce very complex sounds with true and real analogue circuits build on, e.g. breadboards, and let the Pi sample these waves, pass them to filters and effects and convert them to digital audio that can be played with a masterkeyboard.
One very important aspect of this project is its educational attitude: 
pupils should learn how to build interesting sounding circuits and how these sound are transferred to the digital world.
